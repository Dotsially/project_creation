[] Refactor chunk mesh generation to allow blocks with different growth stages, slabs,
    stairs, etc.
[] Add ability for chunk to render models
[] Make entity data driven with json    
[] Create a model importer (filetype tbd.) for character models and blocks

Task for today:
[] 

Done:
[X] Create a block data class for the chunk so that different growth stages 
    and directional blocks work and visibility of said block.
[X] Create a file reader that reads and translates json files of block data to a block class
