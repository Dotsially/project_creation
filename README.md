Unfinished c++ voxel engine that I wanted to make a game with. The codebase became a slog to work with which demotivated me to continue. 
I've decided to remake this but still unsure how.

Features
- Mesh based chunk system (No greedy meshing)
- Chunk render distance
- Procedural noise based terrain
- Block breaking and placing
- DDA Voxel traversal algorithm.
- Mouse picking.
- Centered mouse or free mouse with X button.
- Runs smoothly on a i5 7th gen intel cpu and intergrated graphics.

Libraries used
- glad
- SDL2
- FastNoiseLight
